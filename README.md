# Make

Command:

`make *make_target* *make_options*`

&nbsp;

| Make targets | Description |
| ---          | ---         |
| **std**      | Standard (1D blocking) kernel. |
| **chstd**    | Channelized version of the above kernel. |
| **blk2d**    | 2D overlapped (i.e. 1.5D) kernel. |
| **chblk2d**  | Channelized version of the above kernel. |
| **blk3d**    | 3D overlapped (i.e. 2.5D) kernel. | 
| **chblk3d**  | Channelized version of the above kernel. | 
| **sch**      | Serial channel kernel designed for the Nallatech 510T board. |

&nbsp;

| Make options                  | Description | Default |
| ---                           | ---         | ---     |
| **INTEL_FPGA=1** | Compile for Intel FPGAs. Relevant environmental variables should be set as defined in Intel's documentation. | Disabled |
| **AMD=1** | Compile for AMD's OpenCL SDK. Requires the "AMDAPPSDKROOT" environmental variable to be defined. Channelized kernels not supported. | Disabled |
| **NVIDIA=1** | Compile for NVIDIA's OpenCL SDK. Requires the "CUDA_DIR" environmental variable to be defined. Channelized kernels not supported. | Disabled |
| **HOST_ONLY=1** | Only compile host code without compiling kernel code. | Disabled |
| **KERNEL_ONLY=1** | Only compile kernel code without compiling host code. | Disabled |
| **EMULATOR=1** | Compile for emulation. | Disabled |
| **FOLDER=VALUE** | Override compilation folder. | Same folder as the makefile. |
| **BOARD=VALUE** | Override board name. If BSP supports only one board/hardware, that board will be automatically chosen without needing to supply this option. | Disabled |
| **NDR=1** | Compile NDRange variation of the kernel. | Unset which will compile the Single Work-item variation |
| **BSIZE=VALUE** | Override block size. Overrides both dimensions of the block size for 2.5D blocking kernels. | 1024 (1024x1024 for 2.5D) |
| **VEC=VALUE** | Override vector size for global memory accesses. | 1 |
| **FMAX=VALUE** | Override the post-place-and-route operating frequency. Require Fmax hack to be enabled (see below). | Disabled |
| **TFMAX=VALUE** | Override the target Fmax for the OpenCL compiler. Can help increase (or decrease) the post-place-and-route operating frequency by 10-50 MHz and meet timing when coupled with FMAX option. Comes at a modest increase in logic and Block RAM usage and might increase loop II if increased too much. Determined by OpenCL compiler; check the HTML report. | Disabled |
| **SEED=VALUE** | Override placement and routing seed. Can help increase (or decrease) the operating frequency by 10-30 MHz and meet timing when coupled with FMAX option. Comes at no extra area cost. | Disabled |
| **DEPTH=VALUE** | Override channel depth for channelized kernels. | 16 |
| **NO_INTER=1** | Disable interleaving of global memory arrays between external memory banks. | Disabled |
| **NO_CACHE=1** | Disable the cache automatically generated by the OpenCL compiler in certain cases when burst coalesced global memory ports are inferred. | Disabled |


# Run

Command:

`./fpga-mem-bench *run_options*`

&nbsp;

| **-pad_y VALUE** | Number of floats added to the start of all columns in the arrays as padding. Affect memory access alignment. Only applicable to [ch]blk3d implementations. | 0 |
| **-hw VALUE** | Halo/overlapping width. Memory accesses start from -VALUE floats outside of the grid, and blocks are overlapped by 2 * VALUE. Affects memory access alignemtn and amount of redundant memory accesses. | 0 |
| **--verbose** | Print what the benchmark is doing at each step. Will also print details of incorrect output values if coupled with --verify. | Disabled |
| **--verify** | Verify correctness of values in output buffers against expected values calcualted on the host CPU. | Disabled |
| **-h/--help** | Print benchmark help and exit. | Disabled |


# Benchmark scripts

Bash-based benchmark scripts are provided in the repository for ease of benchmarking. However, they might or might not work on your environment out of the box and modifications will very likely be required to get them to work correctly. Specifically, the variables that are set at the top of the benchmark scripts pretty much always need to be changed.
